				<p><b>Religious.</b> It’s a label used to describe people with inflexible conditions, imposed on others, and the perception that these people are better than everyone else. It’s not a new label. In fact, everyone has a tendency to be “religious” because “being religious” was less about what you believe and more about how you behave. A vegan can be just as devoted to his/her cause as a street evangelist, and a person lobbying for climate change. So what does it really mean to be religious? Does simply adhering to a belief system make you religious?</p>

<p>Jesus tells a story in Luke 18 ESV where,</p>
<p><i>Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. <b>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</b></i></p>

<p>Both men believed in God, but there was a stark difference between the two. One acknowledged his achievements for God, the other acknowledged his need of Him. An exalted, religious attitude, is self-focused. While a humble one acknowledges the need for help. Like the pharisee and the tax collector, we can believe the same God, but what comes out of our mouth tells a great deal about what’s really in our hearts.</p>

<p>Let me ask this another way: What’s the difference between a Christian and a non-christian? The Answer: Nothing, except Jesus. Without Jesus, without the cross, we are no different from people who believe or do not believe. That is both a sobering thought and a safeguard as a believer. We are no different, but because of Jesus we can be.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Read the story in Luke 18 again. Do you find yourself more like the pharisee or the tax collector?</h2>
