<p>What does a phone, an anniversary and a parking lot have in common? They are simple, crucial things that can send you into a panic if you forget them. Whether it’s your keys, your wallet, or your spouse’s birthday, nothing can send you into mental and emotional dread faster than forgetting something important.</p>

<p>Scripture is no different. Have you ever glossed over a verse because ‘you knew that already’? Do you remember how that verse or story went accurately, or is it kind of a blur?</p>

<p>Guys implore a “triple-tap” before they leave the house to avoid forgetting keys, wallets and phones. So here’s a spiritual “triple-tap” to help your remember your favourite verses on the go:</p>

<h1>*Tap 1:* — Memorise</h1>
<p>Take a verse and read it over and over until you can remember what it really says. Start with something simple like John 11:35 or Psalm 1:3</p>

<h1>*Tap 1:* — Memorise</h1>
<p>Write or type it out several times to reinforce what you’ve memorised.</p>

<h1>*Tap 3* — Recite out loud</h1>
<p>Hearing yourself say the verse out loud not only jogs your memory, but it’s declaring God’s Word over your life.</p>
