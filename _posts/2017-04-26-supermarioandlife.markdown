<p>Growing up in the early 80’s, Super Mario Bros. was easily one of the greatest joys and annoyances for anyone who dared to own a Nintendo. It was notorious for presenting players with a very difficult challenge with very limited tries. Every stage was increasingly more hair-raising than the last and required more skill to get the red-suited plumber to the end of the stage. At some point, to the frustration of millions, you’d get stuck and after exhausting your extra lives, you’re back to Level 1-1. All that hard work and progress for nothing. </p>

<p>Super Mario Bros. is a metaphor for life: there are obstacles in our way to reach our goal. Sometimes it’s straightforward, but every now and then, there’s that one Goomba that gets in our way, or one falling platform we missed. We’d have to start again. We can find ourselves in the same predicament. There’s always that one struggle, that one recurring sin that messes us up and we have to start again. Sometimes we can’t beat it, and rather not deal with it, we turn off the console and walk away. But walking away doesn’t beat the stage, or clear the challenge. It leaves us unable to move forward.</p>

<p>In Super Mario, there are greater things beyond the challenges on the stage. Ultimately, it’s to beat Bowser and his minions <i>(our enemy)</i>, conquer the castle <i>(our challenges)</i> and save the princess <i>(things that are important to us)</i>. But none of that happens if we put the controller down. There are greater things beyond the current challenges we face in life, but none of that happens if we give up.</p>

<p>The key is not trying harder, but like Mario, it’s getting the <b>‘power-ups’</b>: the invincibility stars, the 1-UPs, the mushrooms and the Fire Flowers. As a Christian, our ‘power-ups’ are scattered all over the Word of God. It’s matter of digging in and finding them; and the next time life hits us hard, it’s a matter of using them. That’s what proclaiming God’s Word does to our lives. It’s the power-ups we need to turn the trials into triumphs.</p>

<p>Doing life without proclaiming God’s Word is like finishing Super Mario without power-ups: it’s harder, more complicated and most of all - NOT the point.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Do you feel powerless to change? In Acts 1:8 Jesus says we will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon us. Read Acts 1:8 and ask God for His Spirit to power you up in that area you need change in.</h2>
