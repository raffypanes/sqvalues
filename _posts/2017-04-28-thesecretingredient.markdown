<p>In the advent of fake news, fake posts, fake social media accounts, fake pictures, fake articles, it’s increasingly difficult to find what’s genuine. Behind the smiles and well-wishes, someone wants to make a sale. Behind the posts, a life is falling apart. People have become so accustomed to seeing what’s false we’ve forgotten what genuine looks like. People can spot a fake a mile away and by the same token, they can also tell when someone is truly being sincere. Sincerity then, is the key to sharing our faith.</p>

<p>In Jesus’s time, people of all different upbringings, social classes, economic backgrounds were drawn to Him. There was something magnetic about His personality that made even criminals feel safe around Him. He loved The Scriptures, but He wasn’t religious. He loved people, but He didn’t tolerate sin. He was King, but got down on His knees and served. In every word and act, He loved God and He loved people into the Kingdom. </p>

<p>Living a life of Faith is simple: <b>Be sincere to God and people.</b></p>

<p>It’s not the eloquence, persuasive arguments or mastery of the scriptures that matters at the end of the day. When it comes to sharing your faith, people don’t care how much you know, they want to know how much you care.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Read the story of Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10. Are you the type of person that people, regardless of their background, feel safe around? Ask God to help you be like Jesus to the people around you.</h2>
