<p>Almost everyone who has owned a mobile phone can attest to never reading the manual (if there was ever one provided). Smartphones are designed to be so intuitive that we use them almost inherently without much thought. Until a few weeks later, where we see the typical <i>“10 tips to get the most out of your phone”</i> article that pops onto our newsfeed. Curiously, we click, in order to understand what hidden secret lies beneath the touch screen.</p>

<p>In like manner, there are words we use without really understanding the meaning of them. We use them out of context, or by association, but when we really think about the meaning, it eludes us. There are some words that when we do learn about their meaning, it gives a much richer context to the sentence we use them in.</p>

<p>The word: <b>‘Proclaim’</b> comes from the Latin word <b>‘Proclamare’</b> which means <i>‘to shout forth’</i> (Pro - forth, Clamare - to shout). There’s an authority inherent to the word that is different from merely ‘saying’ something. When it comes to proclaiming the word of God over our lives, it isn’t merely ‘saying’ or ‘reciting’ verses out loud. It’s speaking it with certainty. Not a repetitious chant or hollow pep-talk, but the genuine belief that His Words have the power to affect the very course of our lives.</p>

<p>There’s a joy that comes when we proclaim God’s Word genuinely, not rattling it off like a catchphrase or slogan. There’s a peace of mind that comes when we speak forth His truth over our circumstances instead of mulling on the worst that could happen. And there’s a confidence that comes knowing, if nothing else, God is true to His Word.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Has proclaiming the Word of God felt empty and repetitious? Pray and ask God to help make His Words becoming real for you.</h2>
