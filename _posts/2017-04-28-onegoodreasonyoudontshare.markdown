<p>Disappointment lurks around the corner of even the most mundane experiences: Wearing your favourite shoes and have them rained on. On a date with a special someone who had a change in plans. Checking out that new coffee place across town but it’s closed on the day you go. Someone forgetting your birthday. At the heart of disappointment is our own unmet expectations. But what happens when we are the cause of disappointment; When we are the cause of unmet expectations? Depending on who we’re disappointing it could be nothing at all or it could mean the “End of the World”. Perhaps, disappointment is a reason why Christians have a hard time being 'Christian'.</p>

<p>Perhaps, there’s an unspoken misconception or expectation about Christianity that Christians need to ‘Hallelujah!’ or ‘Praise The Lord!’ in the face of their struggles and not doing so, somehow tarnishes a Christian’s reputation. Perhaps it’s disappointing people, yourself, or even God, is the reason you think twice about sharing your faith. After all if you can’t live up to ‘perfection’, best not to try at all. But Proverbs 24:16 ESV encourages though that <i>“For the righteous falls seven times and rises again.”</i></p>

<p><b>Christianity isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being perfected.</b></p>

<p>The gravest mistake we can make is to give up altogether. To never share who God has become in our lives simply because we’re not “there” yet is like quitting in the first round. We’ll only get “there” if we don’t give up. By believing until we see His Word become real in our lives.</p>

<p>We will disappoint God, that’s to be expected. But God “will work all things out for our good*”, even our unmet expectations.</p>

<p style="font-size:10px;">*Romans 8:28 ESV</p>
