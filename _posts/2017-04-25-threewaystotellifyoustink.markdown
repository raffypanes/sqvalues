<p>The more we understand God’s word, the more we understand what’s right and wrong. How we practice God’s word can make a difference in being Christlike or being religious. A religious attitude stinks. Like really bad body odour after a hard workout or a humid walk under the sun, everyone notices it except you. Some might be kind enough to point it out, while others just avoid you entirely. Regardless, people can smell a religious, insincere attitude a mile away. But believing in God doesn’t make you stinky, your attitude does. Here’s three ways you can keep your holy ‘underarms’ in check:</p>

<p><b>Am I comparing Inches to Miles?</b><br>Every person is on a different place in their walk with God, some are much further along the way than others. Our job isn’t to penalise people when they don’t meet the same convictions as we do, that’s the Holy Spirit’s role. Our job is to speak the truth in love. To not tolerate sin, but imitate God’s love. After all, we ourselves have our own things we’re wrestling with.</p>

<p><b>Am I comparing Specks to Planks?</b><br>It’s easy, even tempting at times to compare others to our standards and allow their shortcomings to justify our own. For example, ‘I may struggle with porn, but at least I don’t sleep around.’ We are not our own, nor each other’s benchmark. The Bible is, and it’s against God’s word that we should measure ourselves. No more, no less.</p>

<p><b>Am I comparing Lines Crossed to The Cross?</b><br>People will make mistakes and cross our lines, when they do, will we remember The Cross covering our own? It’s easy to point out a fault and leave it at that, but it takes more effort to point out a fault and love the person until they understand we value them over their fault.</p>

<p>We are responsible for our own actions, words and thoughts first and foremost. And the more we have of God’s word in our lives, the more we ought to be careful to see it practiced before it is preached.</p>
