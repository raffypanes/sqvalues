<p>In the 1980s, the G.I. Joe cartoon ended every episode with the phrase: “Knowing is half the battle.” The problem is, they never tell you what the other half of the battle is. While knowing is half the battle, the other half is doing something about it.</p>

<p>The Internet is rife with “good advice” and while entertaining, reading 15 different blogs on how to make your life better, doesn’t make your life better. You have to act on it. Knowing you need to go to the gym doesn’t count as going to the gym. Knowing you should eat healthy does nothing towards your actual diet. Meditating on God’s Word is the same: awareness of doing it doesn’t translate to actually doing it. Actually meditating on God’s Word is the only way you’ll get better at it. It’s okay if you may not see the benefits right away. Remember growth takes time, and being consistent is key. </p>

<p>It’s over time, not overnight. And there’s no better time to start than right now.</p>
