<p>Coffee is arguably one of the greatest discoveries of mankind in the last century. Everyone has their preferred way to enjoy coffee. None of which involves spilling it on clothes. At some point in our lives we’ve either seen or experienced the heart-jolting scare of spilling coffee. As soon as you realise it’s happening you’re in a shocked, uncomfortable panic. You do everything to try to clean up the mess, but sometimes you make it worse. Everywhere you go people can see it, and for the rest of the day you’ve got to deal with it; you become more conscious about yourself than you were ten minutes ago.</p>

<p>Sin is a lot like spilling coffee. One minute the slate of our hearts is clean, the next, we’re in panic, returning to our knee-jerk reaction to do our best to cover it up. We try to make the most of it, like the coffee on our shirt, but no matter the smile we force on our face, the shame of it is crippling. Much like sin. We can wear a mask, but eventually the guilt will eat us up. But we don’t have to wear guilt like a coffee stain. The Cross is the reminder that we don’t have to.</p>

<p>We’re given this wonderful coffee cup of life, but sometimes (many times) we spill it. The Gospel not only affords us a new cup of coffee, but new clothes to replace the stained ones. The greatest part: it’s not a one time offer. Every time we ask God for help, every time we proclaim God’s word in our lives, we send out an SOS. For God to fix our mess, to take over, to get involved. For Him to begin the cleanup process, no matter how bad and ugly the mess is.</p>
