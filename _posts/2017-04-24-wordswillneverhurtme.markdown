<h2>“Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.”</h2><br>
<p>As a schoolyard rhyme, it made for a quick retort to a bully poking fun at kids. Unfortunately, studies are finding that words DO have an effect on people, both in a positive and negative way.<i>"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits"</i>, as mentioned in <b>Proverbs 18:21 ESV</b>. Proclaiming words isn’t merely speaking what’s on your mind, it’s a matter of life and death: either building up or breaking down another person or even ourselves.</p>

<p>What we proclaim can make a difference. We could be getting all the compliments in the world and all it will take is one bad report to shut us down. In the same way, one genuine encouragement can change the course of a person’s life. We are in the habit of speaking life or death over others and ourselves especially. Oddly enough, it’s easier to believe the worst about ourselves than the best. Words that just make us feel good about ourselves isn’t enough to deal with deep issues in our hearts. We need words that are loving, truthful, and brutally honest at times, and the Bible is that.</p>

<p><b>Hebrews 4:12 ESV</b> describes the Word of God as <i>“living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.”</i> It’s wise, comforting and encouraging but doesn’t pull any punches when need be. If a genuine chat with a friend can do wonders for your soul, can you imagine what an honest conversation with God, who really knows you inside out, can do? Let God have a say in who you are, and what’s happening in your life and watch how it can change you.</p>
