<p>It’s been four days on our journey to meditate on God’s Word. If you’ve been following along, you may be wondering whether or not you’re doing it right. Are you able to write down some verses or recite them off the top of your head? These may indicate your knowledge of scripture, but it does not indicate its influence on your life. It’s not how much you know about the Bible that makes the difference, it’s how much you put into practice. The hallmark of meditating on God’s Word is not information, but transformation.</p>

<p>If your goal is to get through a chapter, you’ll get through it and leave none the better. However, if your goal is to discover God’s heart, traversing through scripture becomes time with a Friend. As you seek God’s heart through His Word, the more your thoughts and, in turn, your behaviour is shaped by Him. After all, belief affects behaviour.</p>
