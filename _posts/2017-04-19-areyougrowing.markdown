<p>It’s common sense that whatever’s living, grows. Just as our physical bodies need proper nutrition to grow well, our spirits require the same. While the body craves food, our spirits crave God’s Word. By chewing and digesting food we get nourished, our spirits do the same as we meditate on the Word of God.</p>

<p>A tree grows tall and strong, not because it’s branches reach higher into the sky, but because it’s roots dig deeper into the soil. A tree needs strong roots to <strong>anchor</strong> it to the ground, <strong>absorb</strong> nutrients in the soil and <strong>store</strong> food for the future. Our spirit needs strong roots to anchor us through life’s challenges, take God’s Word to heart, and to live out God-honoring lives for the present and future. Meditating on God’s Word builds the root system of our spiritual life. And strong roots ensure greater growth.</p>

<p>The key to an abundant life begins with God, having Him as the highest value and priority. When we do, then as Jesus says,“…all these things will be added to us.” (see Matthew 6:33)</p>
