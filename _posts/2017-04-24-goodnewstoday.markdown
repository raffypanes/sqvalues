<p>The road of life is fraught with pain, pleasures, joys and sorrows. Challenges in life are inevitable, for conflict is at the very nature of change. Going from 'what is' to 'what can be' is uncomfortable and perilous at times. Yet often, it's through change and conflict that we experience the fullest of life that God intended for us.</p>

<p>Which is why the Gospel is not for a moment of life, it's "Good News" for every facet of it. Without the Gospel, we are left to navigate life's conflicts by ourselves. If decisions don't work out the way we want, we're left with a downward spiral of failure and self-pity. If they do, we set ourselves upward on the slippery slope of pride and arrogance. Life becomes this tight-rope act where one false step sends us tumbling to our end.</p>

<p>The Gospel is the sweet spot. It's "Good News" because it brings us back to the abundant life God intended for us by allowing Him to once again, become a part of our lives. God IS the strength of our hands and, in our weakness, His grace is made perfect. The Gospel isn't just a Get-Out-Of-Jail FREE card, it's a bridge between two worlds: ours and His. The more we allow the Gospel to influence our lives, the bigger that bridge becomes; the more the reality of His world can become the reality of ours.</p>
