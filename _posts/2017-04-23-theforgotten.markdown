<p>Approaching the Bible can be daunting. Where do you start? Which version do you read? Where are the pictures? It’s so “cheem” (Singlish for ‘deep’). In our zeal to learn more about our faith, we plunge head first into the Holy Book forgetting we need the Holy One to help us make sense out of it. Jesus describes the Holy Spirit in John 14:26 as, “…the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.”</p>

<p>To get the most out of the Bible, we need revelation. And The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Revelation, the Revealer of Truth. Meditating, then, is not just a mental exercise; it’s a partnership with the Holy Spirit to discover the buried treasures hidden in God’s Word.</p>

<p>While there are many good explanations and teachings about the Bible from credible sources, nothing is as exhilarating or rewarding as learning God’s Word from God Himself.</p>
