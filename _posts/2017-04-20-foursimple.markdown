<p>With a myriad of duties and responsibilities, our fast-paced culture leaves us little room to take a breather. Finding time for God’s Word seems like a task in and of itself. Here are four simple ways to grow your roots and meditate on God’s Word:</p>

<h1>1. In your commute time</h1>
<p>Technology has made it easier than ever to access God’s Word. Podcasts, audio bibles, and bible apps are simple and convenient ways to get your daily bread in. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/app/" target="_blank" title="The Bible Gateway App">The Bible Gateway App</a> is a great place to start, with multiple translations, references and even has an audio bible. Best of all, it’s free!</p>

<h1>2. In your meal time</h1>
<p>If you’re having one of those days where you’d much rather eat alone than with your colleagues, why not use that time to catch up on your devotions. A chapter over lunch is a refreshing midday breather in the midst of the hustle.</p>

<h1>3. In your exercise time</h1>
<p>Play a podcast during your next run or let worship music fill your head as you pull your next rep. You’ll be building your physical and spiritual muscles at the same time, plus the time goes faster.</p>

<h1>4. In your free time</h1>
<p>The fact is we’ll make time for things we believe are worth it. If there’s no time, we’ll find it. You’ve done it for that new favourite TV show, no reason you couldn’t do it for God’s Word.</p>

<p>No root grows overnight, it’s a daily process. It’s about consistency, not a crash course. The goal is not clocking time, but quality time. Don’t forget to have a conversation with God after meditating on His word.</p>
