<p>The Rube Goldberg Machine has captivated the imagination of audiences of all ages. People have created increasingly complex procedures to accomplish simple tasks. But the premise of a Rube Goldberg Machine is rather simple: pull a trigger that cascades a series of events that lead to a desired outcome. Once activated, the machine runs it’s course until it reaches it’s end. Our brains are much like Rube Goldberg Machines, and words are a simple trigger that sets off a chain reaction in our minds.</p>

<p>As the field of neuroscience begins to expand and help us better understand our brains, a common finding that is emerging from different experiments is that words do have an effect on our minds, and our minds in turn on our overall well-being. People who talk harshly and negatively about themselves, end up displaying harmful behaviour towards themselves. Conversely, people who speak positive words, in turn, exhibit positive behaviour. Words matter because they influence our thoughts, and our thoughts influence our behaviour.</p>

<p>If our own encouraging words have a positive effect on our brains, can you imagine what God’s Word can do for us? Is it a coincidence that Paul, centuries ago, reminded the Roman believers not to be <i>‘conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,’</i> (Romans 12:2 ESV)</p>

<p>Proclaiming the Bible over does more than release positive self-talk. It adjusts the Rube Goldberg Machines of our minds to trigger a new chain of thoughts and thereby a new outcome: life, as God intended, on earth as it is in heaven. The trigger is simple - open your Bible and speak God’s Word over yourself.</p>
