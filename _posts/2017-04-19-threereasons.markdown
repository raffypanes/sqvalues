<p>In our instant, immediate, on-demand world, waiting and patience have almost become negative monikers. Everyone loves the benefits of good results, but not everybody enjoys the process of getting there. Spiritually speaking, when we see the benefits of a solid spiritual life (like a happy marriage, or a person of character) we want it. But the hard work to get there has become a road less travelled. The daily diligence of meditating on God’s word guarantees that we will:</p>

<h1>1. Yield fruit in season</h1>
<p>Seasonal fruit is the sweetest, but only comes out at certain times of the year. The effects of meditating on God’s word daily won’t be apparent at first but will be sweetest at the right time.</p>

<h1>2. Leaves do not wither</h1>
<p>Lush green leaves are perfect for shade and are indicators of healthy trees. Those leaves are sustained by roots underneath that draw nourishment from the soil. Meditating daily nourishes not just your spiritual life, but other areas of your life, while also bringing life to others.</p>

<h1>3. All that we do prospers</h1>
<p>The results of God’s Word are evident when we put them into practice. By aligning our ways to His we will see long-term benefits that last, not short-term solutions that are temporary.</p>

<p>Meditating is key to spiritual growth. It’s the consistency of spending time with God that matters. Remember, growth is over-time not overnight.</p>
